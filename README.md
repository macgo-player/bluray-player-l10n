Localization files for Macgo Blu-ray Player

## XLIFF Files and Stringdict Files

By following Apple's [Internationalization and Localization Guide][], this project contains `[LanguageID].xliff` files exported from Xcode.

The Development Language (Base Language) is English. 

### Special strings in XLIFF

Do not translate `Info.plist` in xliff, especially name and copyright information. Leave them blank. They will be ignored currently.

The source text contains some special symbols, which looks different on a different OS other than macOS. Be aware of them.
